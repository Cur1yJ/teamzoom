        .question-name Q: How Do I Install The System?
        .answers-wrapper
          %label A:
          %ul.list-answers
            %li.answer The installation typically takes 2-3 weeks from initial inquiry to installation.  TeamZoom requires that two primary tasks are completed before the actual installation: 1) contract execution and 2) network setup.  In order to complete them, you will likely need to involve an Associate Principal (contract execution) and Network Administrator (network setup) in a program kick off phone call.  TeamZoom will provide our standard contract and summary network requirements prior to the kick off call.
            %li.answer Once the contract is in place and the network setup is complete, our technicians will perform a site walkthrough with your facilities manager to plan the installation.  It typically requires a full day to complete the installation.  Your games will typically be ready for broadcast within 7 business days after installation.
